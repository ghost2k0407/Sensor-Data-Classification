# **Sensor Data Classification**

## **1. Understanding the Dataset**
The dataset consists of **time-series sensor data** collected over time, where each row represents a **sensor reading** at a given timestamp. The goal is to classify whether the signal **"Passes" or "Fails"** based on sensor values.

### **Dataset Structure**
- **Time**: Timestamp of the recorded signal.
- **Feature Columns (0-589)**: Sensor readings capturing various measurements.
- **Pass/Fail**: Target variable indicating whether the signal was classified as a pass (`1`) or fail (`-1`).

---

## **2. Data Preprocessing**
To prepare the dataset for analysis and model training, the following steps are taken:

### **A. Handling Missing Values**
- Check for missing or `NaN` values in sensor readings.
- **Strategy:** Replace missing values with **mean/median** or remove rows if they are too sparse.

### **B. Feature Scaling**
- Sensor readings have different ranges, so **Standardization** (`StandardScaler`) or **MinMax Scaling** is applied.

### **C. Train-Test Split**
- The dataset is split into **training (80%)** and **testing (20%)** subsets using `train_test_split()`.

---

## **3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
### **A. Visualizing Sensor Distributions**
- **Histograms**: Show how individual sensor readings are distributed.
- **Boxplots**: Identify outliers in the sensor data.

### **B. Correlation Analysis**
- **Heatmap (Seaborn)**: Identify strongly correlated sensor features.
- **Feature Reduction**: Remove redundant sensors that provide duplicate information.

---

## **4. Feature Selection & Engineering**
- Select the most **important sensor readings** that impact the **Pass/Fail** classification.
- Feature engineering techniques like **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** or **Feature Importance (Random Forest/Gradient Boosting)** may be used.

---

## **5. Model Training & Evaluation**
Multiple classification models are trained and evaluated:

### **A. Models Used**
- **Logistic Regression** (Baseline)
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Gradient Boosting Classifier**
- **NaÃ¯ve Bayes Classifier**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Stacking Classifier** (Combining multiple models)

### **B. Performance Metrics**
- **Accuracy Score**
- **Precision, Recall, F1-score**
- **Confusion Matrix** for classification performance.

---

## **6. Insights & Business Impact**
- **What sensor readings indicate a failure?**
  - Certain sensor values may be critical in identifying defective signals.
- **How accurate is the failure prediction?**
  - If models achieve high accuracy (>85%), they can be deployed in real-world signal monitoring.
- **How can this help businesses?**
  - Automated detection of failing signals reduces **manual inspections** and improves **production efficiency**.
